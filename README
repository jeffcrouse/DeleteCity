INTRODUCTION
=========================

Delete City uses the ridiculous storage allotment of web hosting services 
like Dreamhost to cache large amounts of user generated content from sites 
like YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, etc. and then monitors to see if any of 
this content is subsequently taken down. When it finds removed content, 
it automatically posts the content to your WordPress blog. The nature of 
the content can be customized by the user by site, keyword, and other 
criteria. Devious? Maybe. But also one step in the fight against censorship.

INSTALL
=======================

To install the bleeding-edge version, try this:

cd [wordpress root]/wp-content/plugins
git clone https://github.com/jefftimesten/DeleteCity.git


REQUIREMENTS
=========================

*nix only! (Mac or Linux server) I use a bunch of system commands (mostly for process control) that I don't know how to 
translate into Windows. I'd love someone to help me, though!

PHP >= 5.1 (according to http://phpduck.com/minimum-php-version-script/)
Python >= 2.5

IMPORTANT: Apparently many videos are blocked outside of the US, so this plugin will probably fail for non-US users.


YOUTUBE-DL
========================

This is a 3rd party script for downloading YouTube videos. You probably 
shouldn't use this directly - it is called from the other scripts.  You can 
find out more about it here:  http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/


TO DO
=========================

-- Sort videos by feed

-- Allow usernames in blacklist

-- regex validation for rate limit 

-- Imlement dc_max_cache_size options (they currently do nothing)

-- Can I include some file in runcache that will allow me to get Wordpress options? That would allow me to avoid all of this parameter passing...

-- What should happen if someone changes their cache directory?

-- Redesign admin interface -- need some UX help

-- Testing if video had been removed: testing for presence of <?xml in response probably isn't good enough.  Here are some removed videos to test with.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eouvTRd6szQ 				account terminated
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgEo_7rMH0Q				account terminated
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdGJxI6LrX4				removed by user
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQsFI4Wp6kI				removed by user

-- Option to automatically email the video author to ask why the video was taken down :)

-- Batch query in runcache.php?

-- Catch exceptions from Video class

-- Clean up runcache -- it's messy!

-- System for incremental database updates (for instance, adding the 'posted' column to a running plugin). 

-- Database security: save database file outside of web-readable directory?  Is there a better way?

-- Central database (on deletecity.org) ping when a deleted video is found. (optional for user)

-- Use PDO instead of SQLite

-- Look for media restriction tag in XML
	eg: http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/LnKJpYGCLsg
	<media:restriction type='country' relationship='deny'>DE</media:restriction>
	
	http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/CD2LRROpph0
	<media:restriction type='country' relationship='deny'>DE</media:restriction>
