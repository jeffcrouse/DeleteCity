INTRODUCTION
=========================


Delete City uses the ridiculous storage allotment of web hosting services 
like Dreamhost to cache large amounts of user generated content from sites 
like YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, etc. and then monitors to see if any of 
this content is subsequently taken down. When it finds removed content, 
it automatically posts the content to your WordPress blog. The nature of 
the content can be customized by the user by site, keyword, and other 
criteria. Devious? Maybe. But also one step in the fight against censorship.

INSTALL
=======================
To install the plugin in your Wordpress, try this:

cd [wordpress root]/wp-content/plugins
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jefftimesten/DeleteCity.git


REQUIREMENTS
=========================

*nix only!  I use a bunch of system commands that I don't know how to translate into Windows.  
I'd love someone to help me, though!

PHP >= 5.1 (may be compatible with PHP4, according to http://phpduck.com/minimum-php-version-script/)
Python >= 2.5


OTHER FILES
========================

youtube-dl
This is a 3rd party script for downloading YouTube videos. You probably 
shouldn't use this directly - it is called from the other scripts.  You can 
find out more about it here:  http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/



TO DO
=========================

-- add proxy.conf -- a list of proxies to use randomly IF youtube-dl starts returning errors

-- Testing if video had been removed: testing for presence of <?xml in response probably isn't good enough.  Here are some removed videos to test with.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eouvTRd6szQ 				account terminated
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgEo_7rMH0Q				account terminated
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdGJxI6LrX4				removed by user
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQsFI4Wp6kI				removed by user

-- Save video description, and other attributed of the video from the feed.

-- Option to automatically email the video author to ask why the video was taken down :)

-- Batch query in check.php?

-- low priority: If an orphan file is encountered that has been removed from YouTube, it will never get inserted into the database because we can't fetch info for it.  Need a better solution for this, or maybe it is just unavoidable.  Maybe the solution is to just save http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/{$this->youtube_id} as an XML file in the cache directory?  That is a lot of redundant information: you have stuff in the database and in the XML files.  

-- Catch exceptions from Video class

-- Clean up runcache -- it's messy!

-- Admin interface for 1) frequency of caching 2) sources 3) frequency of posting 4) ?

-- System for incremental database updates (for instance, adding the 'posted' column to a running plugin).  Which raises the question: when a plugin is auto-updated, does it delete everything in the plugin directory?  If so, I'll have to move the cache, log, database out of the plugin dir
